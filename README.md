- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jaaychi
- 👀 I’m interested in building fullstack web applications or any kind of software applications. Feel free to heck out my front end projects along with my backend projects! I also have a couple vanilla javascript projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby & Ruby on Rails. The next programming languages I will learn is Java and Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a big team of developers and learn as much as possible.
